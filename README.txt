Client connects using TCP and sends her
name to the server, the server validates the data input, i.e. they
are alphabetic characters, and echoes it back to the client.
Server1 is the server for sending the client name And NameClient is the client for that server. 
The port numbers are set to the same port already and the server will listen for all address.
Run the server then client and there will be prompts for input.

For the second socket this utility includes a client that inputs up to 4
numbers interactively and a server that returns TRUE/ FALSE
if they are, or are not, powers of two. 
MathServer is the server and MathClient is the client.
The port numbers are set to the same port already and the server will listen for all address.
Run the server then client and there will be prompts for input.
